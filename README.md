# Pipelined-RISC-Processer

ðŸ§  Project Objective:
To design and simulate a simplified RISC processor(RISC-V) that implements instruction-level pipelining to increase instruction throughput.

ðŸš€ Why This Project?
Simulates the heart of modern CPUs.
Teaches core VLSI frontend concepts: data path design, control logic, hazard handling, and pipeline optimization.
Helps you understand and implement real-world digitalÂ processors.
